Greetings, fellow curious people! Welcome to my blog dedicated to my learning journey. In this blog, I will be writing about various mathematical/scientific topics.

My name is Nurbek, I am a MSc student in applied mathematics, this blog started out as a way of disciplinging myself and documenting my courses. Additionally, according to Feynmann's learning method, the best way to learn something is to teach it. Thus buckle up, let's dive in!
