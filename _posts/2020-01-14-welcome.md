# Metric spaces

Metrics spaces are a foundation of functional analysis. 

*Definition: A Metric Space* is a set X equipped with some *metric*, which is a distance function.
In order for a function to be considered a valid metric, it has to follow certain axioms:

- $d(x, y) \geq 0$, $d(x, y)=0 \implies x=y$ - non-negativity
- $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ - symmetry
- $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$ for all $x, z, y \in X$ - triangle inequality

*Examples:*

A real line **R** equipped with $d(x, y) = \lvert x-y \rvert$ is a metric space.

Indeed, we can check that non-negativity is guaranteed by the absolute function, as well as the fact that the metric is zero only if x=y. Symmetry can be shown as follows, $\lvert x-y \rvert = \lvert -(y-x) \rvert \implies \lvert y-x \rvert$. Finally, to show the triangle inequality, we must prove that $\lvert x-y \rvert \leq \lvert x-z \rvert + \lvert z-y \rvert$. One way to prove is to consider cases of the point z.

If $x \leq z \leq y$:

$\lvert x-y \rvert = (y-x) = (y-z)+(z-x)$. Basically, we partitioned the segment $xy$, by a point z, which does not impact the length for the case when z is somewhere in between these points.

If $z \leq x \leq y$:

$\lvert x-z \rvert + \lvert y-z \rvert = (x-z)+(y-z)$, since $(y-z) \geq (y-x)$ and $x-z$ is non-negative. We get $\lvert x-y \rvert \leq \lvert z-y \rvert + \lvert x-z \rvert$, the last is something non-negative.  So the triangle inequality holds.

A set can be equipped with different metrics and we would get different metric spaces. Another choice could be $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\lvert x-y \rvert}$. First 2 axioms follow from the previous example, so we only need to show that the triangle inequality holds. $d(x, y)^2 = \lvert x-y \rvert \leq \lvert x-z \rvert + \lvert z-y \rvert \leq \lvert x-z \rvert + \lvert z-y \rvert +2\sqrt{\lvert x-z \rvert}\sqrt{\lvert z-y  \rvert} = (\sqrt{\lvert x-z \rvert} + \sqrt{\lvert z-y \rvert})^2 = (d(x, z) + d(z, y))^2$

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

## Tables
